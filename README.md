### Currently Working on:
  - main functionality of Fotask
    - Add new task to task list
    - When the start button is clicked, the timer of first task in list starts the timer countdown 
    - When the timer ends, that task automatically deletes and the next task in line starts its timer 
    - the timer stops when the stop button is clicked
    - ability to edit the task name and time duration
    - ability to delete a task in task list
 
### Features yet to come:
  - buttons to effortlessly add "break" tasks with 5-30 minute duration to set inbetween working tasks
  - old tass return to end of the task list once the task is "done", aka, the timer ends.
  - customizable options to change overall theme to different varieties of color palettes
  - customizable option to change alarm sounds
  - change the font color of timer countdown when timer is active. 
  - a suggestion inbox for others to suggest new features to be added, bugs/glithces, or anything else to help improve Fotask.
  - turn this into a downloadable desktop app
  - improve on Fotask Logo


### Plans for future?
This project is currently set to private until completion. I have yet to decide if Fotask should be open source or not, but what I have decided is to make Fotask free to download for anyone who wants to use it. I can not wait to finish this project to increase my productivity, as well as sharing it with the world in hopes it would help others too.
